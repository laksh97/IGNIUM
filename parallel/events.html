ELIGIBILITY:</br>

<ul>	<li> The event is open to all regular B. Tech students</li></ul>
EVENT DESCRIPTION:</br>
Code Relay is a one day coding contest based on logic analyzing skills for technical questions and team work.


<ul><li>	Round 1:<br>A team will be asked to pick up a chit containing a technical question which should be solved within a time limit of 15 minutes. Whichever team solves it first will have a benefit of entering the lab to choose their system first and discuss till the duration of 15minutes of round 1 is completed, which can serve as additional discussion time needed for round 2( in case they solve it early before the end of 15 minutes time limit.)
</li><li>Round 2:<br>
Any system a team chooses after entering lab will have a sheet with a problem statement for which the code can be implemented either in C/JAVA. The team can discuss on the logic to be built/code segments to be implemented until first 15 minutes of round 1 is completed. Then one of them must leave the lab and the other person individually starts developing the code, after25 minutes the teammates must swap their positions and continue individually for another 25 minutes. Then a last 10 minutes they can work together to get the output. The problem statement given will be simple enough to be solved within the time limit. 

 </li></ul>

WINNER SELECTION CRITERIA:
<ul><li>A team who could complete solving the problem on time or within the time will be given the merit.
</li><li>If no one could complete the task there will be an evaluation of their codes and based on its feasibility the winner will be decided by two evaluators.
</li><li>If there is a tie there will be a tie breaker technical question and whichever team solves it first will be declared as the winners.
</li><li>Top three teams will be given merit certificates.
